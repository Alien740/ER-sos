# 🚨 Emergency Response Application

## 📖 Introduction
The Emergency Response Application is a mobile-first and cloud-supported system designed to provide immediate assistance during critical situations such as accidents, medical emergencies, or natural disasters.  
Users can send SOS alerts with real-time location data, while responders monitor incidents through a web dashboard.
